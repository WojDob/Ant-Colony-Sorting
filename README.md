# Ant-Colony-Sorting

This is my final project for a university course called "combinatorial optimisation". It uses a metaheuristic algorithm - Ant Colony Optimization - to solve a complex flow shop scheduling problem. It's old and the code is chaotic, if I were writing it now, I would make it more readable, efficient and documented.

The InstanceGenerator.py generates random instances of the tasks, which are then stored in a text file used by Sorter.py, where the actual ACO algorithm is used.
